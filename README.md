# Accelerated Results Fitness Cookbook # 
A fully responsive and beautiful website to help with your nutrition. Users can login, add, edit, delete their own recipes. Users can add unique items to their grocery list, or add ingredient names from recipes.

## Link to project 

With heroku stepping away from free hosting I need to do some research of where I can host this...its coming soon!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB, EJS

## Optimizations

This is truly a MVP. Users can signup, login, enter their own recipes and have full CRUD functionality with each one. 

What is coming? - This is a long and ever growing list. Below isn't everything, but it is the most important functionality I will implement before making it available to the public.

1. Grocery List functionality, ability to add recipe ingredient names to the grocery list, or individual items. (DONE)
2. Users can view other recipes added by other uses, and favorite those recipes to view with ease later.
3. Users can comment on their own, or others recipes. 
4. Users can favorite other recipes added by other users to easily view later
5. An endless amount of styling to make the appearance more sleek, modern, and user friendly.
