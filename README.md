A fully responsive and beautiful website to help with your nutrition. Users can login, add, edit, delete their own recipes. Users can add unique items to their grocery list, or add ingredient names from recipes. Users can view other recipes added by other members of the community and favorite them for easy viewing later. More functionality coming listed under optimizations.

With heroku leaving free hosting my plan is to switch to something new this weekend

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB, EJS

## Known Issues

1. Fix some responsive issues on the edit recipe modal

## Optimizations

What is coming? - This is a long and ever growing list. Below isn't everything as I am always thinking of ideas for improvement, but as of now I am comfortable releasing this.

1. Add ability to add multiple grocery items at once
2. Add ability to edit grocery list instead of just update/delete
3. Add ability to delete favorites
4. A view all recipes link (for user recipes only)
5. Add calories per serving and a way to track your calories
6. Add a meal planning function where users can place recipes into timeslots/days and choose serving amount
7. I've enjoyed the attempts of the styling on my own, but I am not a designer. I am diving into some UI/UX courses that hope will give me some better insight on how to make things look great!
8. Rebuild the entire thing with React - I am actually very much looking forward to that!
