# Accelerated Results Fitness Cookbook # 
A fully responsive and beautiful website to help with your nutrition. Users can login, add, edit, delete their own recipes. Users can add unique items to their grocery list, or add ingredient names from recipes. More functionality coming listed under optimizations.

## Link to project 

With heroku stepping away from free hosting I need to do some research of where I can host this...its coming soon!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB, EJS

## Optimizations

What is coming? - This is a long and ever growing list. Below isn't everything, but it is the most important functionality I will implement before making it available to the public.

1. Add a feed page, where users can see other recipes added by others. They'll be able to favorite them to easy viewing later.
2. Add ability to add multiple grocery items at once, and also be able to edit the list.
3. Add a boolean value to the groceries modal that will flip items from complete or not to eliminate some client side JS code.
4. Fix some responsive queries on the edit modal.
5. I've enjoyed the styling of the application on my own, I am diving into some UI/UX courses, and am looking forward to making this look much better!
