1. Grocery List functionality, ability to add recipe ingredient names to the grocery list, or individual items. (DONE)
2. Users can view other recipes added by other uses, and favorite those recipes to view with ease later.
3. Users can comment on their own, or others recipes. 
4. Users can favorite other recipes added by other users to easily view later
