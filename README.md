## Optimizations

This is truly a MVP. Users can signup, login, enter their own recipes and have full CRUD functionality with each one. 

What is coming?

1. Grocery List functionality, ability to add entire recipe ingredient lists to a grocery list, or individual items.
2. Users can view other recipes added by other uses, and favorite those recipes to view with ease later.
3. Users can comment on their own, or others recipes. 
4. Users can meal plan their week on a weekly basis by entering in recipe names for different days/times.
